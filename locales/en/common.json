    "body": "Hi ðŸ‘‹<br /><br />My name is Igor Kuzmenko. I love my wife, son, dog and cat. And I love making things up and making them real (but more often this doesn't happen).<br /><br />For a long time, my personal page seemed like an official paper with a bunch of clichÃ©s, so I got sick of it and turned it into something what feels more like me and my approach to life: a combination of lightness, aesthetics, some seriousness and humor (and modesty).<br /><br />I spend my spare time with my family, doing pet projects, playing video games and more: from playing the ukulele and drawing, to electrical engineering and sports car driving.<br /><br />I've tried countless times to increase my online presence, but it never lasts long ðŸ™ƒ<br /><br />My social networks and contacts are available here: <a href=\"https://fundof.me/igor\">fundof.me/igor</a>"
