{"pageProps":{"post":{"html":"<p>Here is the list of competitive programming sites that allow you to use JavaScript in order to submit your solution:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/\">HackerRank</a> supports a lot of languages, has many active registered users (I believe something around 70-80k), smooth user experience and UI. Supports contests, splits problems in domains, so you can practice what you want and need. Recommended for JavaScript developers since you don't have a feeling of using old-school tools.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codeeval.com/\">CodeEval</a> has clunky UI/UX, not as comfortable as HackerRank and may confuse you with status of your submission. Apart from that it's good enough to give it a shot. The community is not that big, something around 10k I guess.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.codewars.com/\">CodeWars</a> looks nice and feels nice. It's focused more on sharpening language skills, so not too many languages are supported now, but you still have a lot of interesting problems to solve. Interesting ranking system and you can compare your solution with others.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.spoj.com/\">SPOJ</a> is also a well known place to practice your skills as well as participate and create in different contests. Haven't used too much, but looks good. A lot of people recommend it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://coderbyte.com/challenges/\">CoderByte</a>. Personally I haven't used it, but it exists. At least this fact is worth of mentioning it :) Has not so many challenges.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://projecteuler.net/\">The Project Euler</a> only requires you to enter the right answer, therefore there is no restriction on the language you use. Incredibly popular as far as I know.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I want to keep this list up-to-date, so if you know more online judging systems and/or coding challenging platforms that support JavaScript, please leave the comment below.</p>","type":"blog","meta":{"slug":"coding-challenges-for-javascript-developers","title":"Coding Challenges for Javascript Developers","layout":"post","lang":"en","description":"The list of competitive programming sites that allow you to use JavaScript to submit solutions\n","tags":["technology","problems solving","javascript","tips"],"date":"2016-01-20 18:10:13 +0200"}},"_nextI18Next":{"initialI18nStore":{"ua":{"common":{"common":{"name":"Ігор Кузьменко","version":"версія","articleFooter":"Сподобалась стаття?
