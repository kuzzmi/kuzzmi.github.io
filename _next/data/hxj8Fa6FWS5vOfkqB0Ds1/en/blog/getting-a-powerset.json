{"pageProps":{"post":{"html":"<p>I found this problem as a technical interview question. So why not to solve it? More stuff solved = even more similar stuff can be solved. Right?</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In mathematics, <strong>the power set</strong> (or powerset) of any set S, written P(S), â„˜(S), â„™(S) or 2S, is the set of all subsets of S, including the empty set and S itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we try to solve that by creating base cases to find a pattern, we might find some rules.</p>\n<p>So, <code>P([x,y,z])</code> has to be <code>[[], [x], [y], [z], [x, y], [x, z], [y, z], [x, y, z]]</code>.</p>\n<p>If we find <code>P([x])</code>, the result will be <code>[[], [x]]</code>. Which is a reflection of \"including the empty set and S itself\".</p>\n<p>If we add <code>y</code> here, so need to find <code>P([x, y])</code>, the result will be <code>[[], [x], [y], [x, y]]</code>. Which is a union <code>P([x]) U P([y])</code>.</p>\n<p>If we add <code>z</code>, so <code>P([x, y, z])</code>, than it will become a union <code>P([x, y]) U P([x, z]) U P([y, z])</code>.</p>\n<p>So to find a powerset of S we need to find all its subsets. In order to do this we need to find all subsets of its subset and so on. So we're dealing with recursion, aren't we?</p>\n<p>Let's go and do it!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title function_\">getPowerset</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">S</span>) {\n    <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// cloning S, so we don&#x27;t change old S</span>\n    S = S.<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">slice</span>();\n\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> P = [];\n\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> (S.<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">length</span> === <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>) {\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// f([]) should return [ [] ]</span>\n        P.<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">push</span>([]);\n    } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">else</span> {\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Store the first element from S</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// and remove it from S</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> e = S.shift();\n\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// Get the powerset of S without first element</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> p = getPowerset(S);\n\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// For each set in powerset without the first element</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// we add a set and a set with the first element</span>\n        <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// to the current powerset storage</span>\n        p.forEach(<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">s</span>) {\n            P.<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">push</span>(s);\n            P.<span class=\"hljs-built_in\">push</span>(s.concat([ e ]));\n        });\n    }\n\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> P;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Yep, that's it.
