After digging through the docs I found an <a href=\"https://reacttraining.com/react-router/native/example/custom-link\">example</a>, that does what I need, but what I had to figure out after just staring at the source code for about a half an hour.</p>\n<p><strong>Activity indication is freaking important enough in routing library to be missed as a separate \\\"LOOK HOW IT'S DONE\\\" example.</strong></p>\n<p>Couldn't stress this enoughâ€¦ Anyway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"activityindicator\">Activity indicator</h2>\n<p>The key is that the routing now is fully declarative, meaning that it allows us to make it so if there are several routes that match the needed path, all of them will be rendered. But instead of rendering a specific page component, you can render out a <code>Link</code> as a child, and use <code>match</code> argument of the <code>Route</code> rendering property.</p>\n<p>The following example needs to be tweaked just a bit to work in web, but here's the React Native version:</p>\n<pre class=\"javascript language-javascript\"><code class=\"hljs javascript language-javascript\">{% raw %}\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> { <span class=\"hljs-title class_\">Route</span>, <span class=\"hljs-title class_\">Link</span> } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">&#x27;react-router-native&#x27;</span>;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title function_\">LinkWithIndicator</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">{ to, label }</span>) {\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> (\n        <span class=\"language-xml\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">Route</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">path</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">{</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">to</span> } <span class=\"hljs-attr\">children</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">{({</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">match</span> }) =&gt;</span> (\n            <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">Link</span>\n                <span class=\"hljs-attr\">to</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">{</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">to</span> }&gt;</span>\n                <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">Text</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">style</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">{{</span>\n                    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">color:</span> <span class=\"hljs-attr\">match</span> ? &#x27;#<span class=\"hljs-attr\">A060E5</span>&#x27; <span class=\"hljs-attr\">:</span> &#x27;<span class=\"hljs-attr\">black</span>&#x27;,\n                }}&gt;</span>{ label }<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">Text</span>&gt;</span>\n            <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">Link</span>&gt;</span>\n        )}/&gt;</span>\n    );\n}\n\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">/*\n * Usage:\n\n &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;\n    &lt;LinkWithIndicator to=&quot;/example1&quot; label=&quot;Example 1&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;LinkWithIndicator to=&quot;/example2&quot; label=&quot;Example 2&quot; /&gt;\n &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;\n\n */</span>\n{% endraw %}\n</code></pre>","type":"blog","meta":{"slug":"react-router-v4-activity-indicator","title":"React-Router v4: Activity indicator","layout":"post","lang":"en","description":"A simple example of how to create a react-router link with indication of being active\n","tags":["technology","react","react-native","javascrip"],"date":"2017-07-14 13:27:17 +0200"}},"_nextI18Next":{"initialI18nStore":{"en":{"common":{"common":{"name":"Igor Kuzmenko","version":"version","articleFooter":"If you enjoyed the reading, you can tip me <a href=\"https://fundof.me/kuzzmi?tip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> ðŸ˜‰","articleNotAvailable":"This content is available only in Ukrainian."},"menu":{"home":"Home","blog":"Tech articles","thoughts":"Thoughts","podcast":"Podcast","projects":"Projects","about":"About me"},"home":{"meta":{"description":"Home page of Igor Kuzmenko"},"bio":"developer and tech entrepreneur","read":"Read","recents":"Recent publications","description":{"part_1":"Here I publish ","part_2":"my thoughts","part_3":" and ","part_4":" tech articles","part_5":".
