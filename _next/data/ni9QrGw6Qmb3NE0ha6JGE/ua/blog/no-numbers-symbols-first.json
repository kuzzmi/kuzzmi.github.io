{"pageProps":{"post":{"html":"<p>How often you have a feeling that you could do something more efficiently? Regardless of what it is. It can be related to opening files, writing a function, typing or managing windows on the screen.</p>\n<p>As a programmer I have this feeling all the time. <a href=\"/blog/code-completion-thank-you-but-no\">Here</a> I've tried to describe my experience with adopting a no-colors and no-code-completion feature.</p>\n<p>Now it's a time for a new experiment: I've decided to move all the numbers to the combination of <code>Shift+[number]</code> and symbols to just <code>[number]</code>.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking during development I should not use hardcoded numbers (however I need those in styling). So instead I should, for example declare them somewhere on the top and then reference them with a constant name. After realizing that I decided to make this experiment and now the first full working day is succesfully passed.</p>\n<p>I'll try to keep this post updated with results of the experiment, but I have a strong feeling that it will work very nice in the long run.</p>\n<p>This is how it looks like in <code>.vimrc</code></p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs\">&quot; Remapping symbols to their pair number\ninoremap ! 1\ninoremap @ 2\ninoremap <span class=\"hljs-comment\"># 3</span>\ninoremap $ 4\ninoremap % 5\ninoremap ^ 6\ninoremap &amp; 7\ninoremap * 8\ninoremap ( 9\ninoremap ) 0\ninoremap [ {\ninoremap ] }\n&quot; ...and numbers to their pair symbols\ninoremap<span class=\"hljs-number\"> 1 </span>!\ninoremap<span class=\"hljs-number\"> 2 </span>@\ninoremap<span class=\"hljs-number\"> 3 </span><span class=\"hljs-comment\">#</span>\ninoremap<span class=\"hljs-number\"> 4 </span>$\ninoremap<span class=\"hljs-number\"> 5 </span>%\ninoremap<span class=\"hljs-number\"> 6 </span>^\ninoremap<span class=\"hljs-number\"> 7 </span>&amp;\ninoremap<span class=\"hljs-number\"> 8 </span>*\ninoremap<span class=\"hljs-number\"> 9 </span>(\ninoremap<span class=\"hljs-number\"> 0 </span>)\ninoremap { [\ninoremap } ]\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"day1\">Day 1</h3>\n<p>A bit hard to get used to a new layout, but in the end of the day I could easily forget about the changes. The most useful thing is remapping <code>9</code> to <code>(</code> and <code>0</code> to <code>)</code>. Overall have a good feeling and big hopes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"day3\">Day 3</h3>\n<p>Oh, I love it. For JavaScript remapping brackets <code>[</code> to <code>{</code> and vice versa was another great decision. I suppose we all type something like this quite often:</p>\n<pre class=\"javascript language-javascript\"><code class=\"hljs javascript language-javascript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"hljs-title function_\">fn</span> = (<span class=\"hljs-params\">a, b</span>) =&gt; {\n <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> (a &amp;&amp; b) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> a * b;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Without remapping to type this we need 58 keystrokes, with = 41. So far so good!</p>\n<h3 id=\"day6\">Day 6</h3>\n<p>Still make mistakes, but much less. Started working more on styling stuff this days, thus I need to type more numbers, so I will probably switch this off for some style-specific file types like CSS, SASS, Less etc. Another observation: after switching to this layout, I subconsciously press <code>;</code> when I need <code>:</code>, may be it's a good idea to try this out as well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"day10\">Day 10</h3>\n<p>Reversed <code>;</code> and <code>:</code> keys. It's so sweet now, I can type faster and with less keystrokes! I'll definitely stick to this mapping for a lo-o-ong time, that's for sure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"day20\">Day 20</h3>\n<p>Very rare mistakes. I'll never come back to the old layout. A few things still need to be tested e.g. I need to type <code>5</code> and <code>6</code> more often than <code>%</code> and <code>^</code>, may be a bit of customization here will work, but I'm worried about consistency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"day30\">Day 30</h3>\n<p>Started prototyping my own keyboard layout, so I can build exactly what I need and I'll take the mapping I tested to my layout :3 Here is a photo of my prototype:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CoZFgcSWcAECyiq.jpg:large\" alt=\"\" /></p>","type":"blog","meta":{"slug":"no-numbers-symbols-first","title":"No Numbers, Symbols First","layout":"post","lang":"en","description":"It's a time for a new experiment: I've decided to move all the numbers to the combination of Shift+[number] and symbols to just [number] key.
