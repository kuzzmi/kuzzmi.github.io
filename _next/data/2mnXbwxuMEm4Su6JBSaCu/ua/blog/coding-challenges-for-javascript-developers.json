{"pageProps":{"post":{"html":"<p>Here is the list of competitive programming sites that allow you to use JavaScript in order to submit your solution:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/\">HackerRank</a> supports a lot of languages, has many active registered users (I believe something around 70-80k), smooth user experience and UI. Supports contests, splits problems in domains, so you can practice what you want and need. Recommended for JavaScript developers since you don't have a feeling of using old-school tools.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.codeeval.com/\">CodeEval</a> has clunky UI/UX, not as comfortable as HackerRank and may confuse you with status of your submission. Apart from that it's good enough to give it a shot. The community is not that big, something around 10k I guess.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.codewars.com/\">CodeWars</a> looks nice and feels nice. It's focused more on sharpening language skills, so not too many languages are supported now, but you still have a lot of interesting problems to solve. Interesting ranking system and you can compare your solution with others.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.spoj.com/\">SPOJ</a> is also a well known place to practice your skills as well as participate and create in different contests. Haven't used too much, but looks good. A lot of people recommend it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://coderbyte.com/challenges/\">CoderByte</a>. Personally I haven't used it, but it exists. At least this fact is worth of mentioning it :) Has not so many challenges.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://projecteuler.net/\">The Project Euler</a> only requires you to enter the right answer, therefore there is no restriction on the language you use. Incredibly popular as far as I know.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I want to keep this list up-to-date, so if you know more online judging systems and/or coding challenging platforms that support JavaScript, please <a href=\"http://twitter.com/kuzzmi\">ping me on Twitter</a>.</p>","type":"blog","meta":{"slug":"coding-challenges-for-javascript-developers","title":"Coding Challenges for Javascript Developers","layout":"post","lang":"en","description":"The list of competitive programming sites that allow you to use JavaScript to submit solutions\n","tags":["technology","problems solving","javascript","tips"],"date":"2016-01-20T18:10:13Z"}},"_nextI18Next":{"initialI18nStore":{"ua":{"common":{"common":{"name":"–Ü–≥–æ—Ä –ö—É–∑—å–º–µ–Ω–∫–æ","version":"–≤–µ—Ä—Å—ñ—è","articleFooter":"–°–ø–æ–¥–æ–±–∞–ª–∞—Å—å —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—Ç—è? –ù–∞ —á–∞–π –º–æ–∂–Ω–∞ –ª–∏—à–∏—Ç–∏ <a href=\"https://fundof.me/kuzzmi?tip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">–æ—Å—å —Ç—É—Ç</a> üòâ","articleNotAvailable":"–¶–µ–π –∫–æ–Ω—Ç–µ–Ω—Ç –¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω–∏–π —Ç—ñ–ª—å–∫–∏ –∞–Ω–≥–ª—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–æ—é –º–æ–≤–æ—é."},"menu":{"home":"–ì–æ–ª–æ–≤–Ω–∞","blog":"–¢–µ—Ö–Ω—ñ—á–Ω—ñ —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—Ç—ñ","thoughts":"–†–æ–∑–¥—É–º–∏","podcast":"–ü–æ–¥–∫–∞—Å—Ç","projects":"–ü—Ä–æ—î–∫—Ç–∏","about":"–ü—Ä–æ –º–µ–Ω–µ"},"home":{"meta":{"description":"–î–æ–º–∞—à–Ω—è —Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ–Ω–∫–∞ –Ü–≥–æ—Ä–∞ –ö—É–∑—å–º–µ–Ω–∫–∞"},"bio":"—Ä–æ–∑—Ä–æ–±–Ω–∏–∫ —Ç–∞ tech –ø—ñ–¥–ø—Ä–∏—î–º–µ—Ü—å","read":"–ß–∏—Ç–∞—Ç–∏","recents":"–û—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–Ω—ñ –¥–æ–ø–∏—Å–∏","description":{"part_1":"–¢—É—Ç —è –ø—É–±–ª—ñ–∫—É—é ","part_2":"—Å–≤–æ—ó —Ä–æ–∑–¥—É–º–∏","part_3":" —ñ ","part_4":" —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω—ñ—á–Ω—ñ —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—Ç—ñ","part_5":". –ó–∞–≤–∑—è—Ç–∏–π –∫–æ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç—É–≤–∞—á Linux —ñ vim. –°–ø—ñ–≤–∑–∞—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫ –≤ "}},"blog":{"description":"–ó–Ω–∞—Ö—ñ–¥–∫–∏ —ñ –≤—Å—ñ–ª—è–∫—ñ —Ü—ñ–∫–∞–≤–æ—Å—Ç—ñ, —è–∫–∏–º–∏ —è –∑–∞—Ö–æ—Ç—ñ–≤ –ø–æ–¥—ñ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—Å—è –∑—ñ —Å–≤—ñ—Ç–æ–º."},"thoughts":{"description":"–ú–æ—ó —Ä–æ–∑–¥—É–º–∏ –ø—Ä–æ –∂–∏—Ç—Ç—è —ñ —Ä–æ–±–æ—Ç—É."},"about":{"body":"–ü—Ä–∏–≤—ñ—Ç, –º–µ–Ω–µ –∑–≤—É—Ç—å –Ü–≥–æ—Ä –ö—É–∑—å–º–µ–Ω–∫–æ. –Ø –ª—é–±–ª—é —Å–≤–æ—é –¥—Ä—É–∂–∏–Ω—É, —Å–∏–Ω–∞, —Å–æ–±–∞–∫—É —Ç–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–∞. –ê —â–µ —è –ª—é–±–ª—é –≤–∏–≥–∞–¥—É–≤–∞—Ç–∏ —Ä—ñ–∑–Ω—ñ —à—Ç—É–∫–µ–Ω—Ü—ñ—ó —ñ –≤—Ç—ñ–ª—é–≤–∞—Ç–∏ —ó—Ö —É –∂–∏—Ç—Ç—è (—ñ–Ω–∫–æ–ª–∏ —Ü–µ –≤–¥–∞—î—Ç—å—Å—è, –∞–ª–µ —á–∞—Å—Ç—ñ—à–µ - –Ω—ñ).<br /><br />–î–æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–Ω—å–æ –¥–æ–≤–≥–æ –º–æ—è –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞ —Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ–Ω–∫–∞ –±—É–ª–∞ —Å—Ö–æ–∂–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ä–µ–∑—é–º–µ —ñ–∑ –∫—É–ø–æ—é –∫–ª—ñ—à–µ, –º–µ–Ω—ñ —Ü–µ –Ω–∞–±—Ä–∏–¥–ª–æ —ñ —è –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–∏–≤ —ó—ó –Ω–∞ —â–æ—Å—å, —â–æ –±—ñ–ª—å—à–µ —Å—Ö–æ–∂–µ –Ω–∞ –º–µ–Ω–µ —ñ –º—ñ–π –ø—ñ–¥—Ö—ñ–¥ –¥–æ –∂–∏—Ç—Ç—è: –ø–æ—î–¥–Ω–∞–Ω–Ω—è –ª–µ–≥–∫–æ—Å—Ç—ñ, –µ—Å—Ç–µ—Ç–∏–∫–∏, –¥–µ—è–∫–æ—ó —Å–µ—Ä–π–æ–∑–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ñ —ñ –≥—É–º–æ—Ä—É (—ñ —Å–∫—Ä–æ–º–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ñ).<br /><br />–£ –≤—ñ–ª—å–Ω–∏–π –≤—ñ–¥ —Ä–æ–±–æ—Ç–∏ —á–∞—Å —è –ø—Ä–æ–≤–æ–¥–∂—É –∑ —Ä–æ–¥–∏–Ω–æ—é, –∑–∞–π–º–∞—é—Å—è –ø–µ—Ç-–ø—Ä–æ—î–∫—Ç–∞–º–∏, –≥—Ä–∞—é —É –≤—ñ–¥–µ–æ —ñ–≥—Ä–∏ —ñ —â–µ –±–∞–≥–∞—Ç–æ —á–æ–≥–æ —Ä–æ–±–ª—é: –≤—ñ–¥ –≥—Ä–∏ –Ω–∞ —É–∫—É–ª—î–ª—î —ñ –º–∞–ª—é–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è, –¥–æ –µ–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ—Ç–µ—Ö–Ω—ñ–∫–∏ —ñ —Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–µ—Ä—É–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—è –∞–≤—Ç—ñ–≤–∫–æ—é.<br /><br />–Ø –±–µ–∑–ª—ñ—á —Ä–∞–∑—ñ–≤ –Ω–∞–º–∞–≥–∞–≤—Å—è –ø—ñ–¥–≤–∏—â–∏—Ç–∏ —Ä—ñ–≤–µ–Ω—å —Å–≤–æ—î—ó –æ–Ω–ª–∞–π–Ω-–ø—Ä–∏—Å—É—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ñ, –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–µ —Ü–µ –Ω—ñ–∫–æ–ª–∏ –Ω–µ —Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞—î –¥–æ–≤–≥–æ üôÉ<br /><br />–ú–æ—ó —Å–æ—Ü—ñ–∞–ª—å–Ω—ñ –º–µ—Ä–µ–∂—ñ —ñ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–∫—Ç–∏ –¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–Ω—ñ –æ—Å—å —Ç—É—Ç: <a href=\"https://fundof.me/igor\">fundof.me/igor</a>"},"tags":{"philosophy":"—Ñ—ñ–ª–æ—Å–æ—Ñ—ñ—è","psychology":"–ø—Å–∏—Ö–æ–ª–æ–≥—ñ—è","story":"–º–æ—è —ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—è","marketing":"–º–∞—Ä–∫–µ—Ç–∏–Ω–≥","startup":"—Å—Ç–∞—Ä—Ç–∞–ø–∏","bad advice":"—à–∫—ñ–¥–ª–∏–≤—ñ –ø–æ—Ä–∞–¥–∏","career":"–∫–∞—Ä'—î—Ä–∞","work":"—Ä–æ–±–æ—Ç–∞","burn out":"–≤–∏–≥–æ—Ä—è–Ω–Ω—è"}}},"en":{"common":{"common":{"name":"Igor Kuzmenko","version":"version","articleFooter":"If you enjoyed the reading, you can tip me <a href=\"https://fundof.me/kuzzmi?tip\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> üòâ","articleNotAvailable":"This content is available only in Ukrainian."},"menu":{"home":"Home","blog":"Tech articles","thoughts":"Thoughts","podcast":"Podcast","projects":"Projects","about":"About me"},"home":{"meta":{"description":"Home page of Igor Kuzmenko"},"bio":"developer and tech entrepreneur","read":"Read","recents":"Recent publications","description":{"part_1":"Here I publish ","part_2":"my thoughts","part_3":" and ","part_4":" tech articles","part_5":".
