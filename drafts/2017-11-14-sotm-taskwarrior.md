          UI is great for CLI tool. There is always space for improvement and I personally wasn't astonished with it, so 4 out of 5 is a good compromise

          It's not easy to set everything up, however it might require quite
          an effort to setup the server, so you can use it on the go
    - type: portability

          TaskWarrior uses JSON and stores everything in plain files

I found [TaskWarrior][1] a few weeks ago and to be honest - this
is by far the best task manager.

This tool is the first and only software that helped me in implementing my
workflow. _(I will write about this workflow in a separate post.)_

All the details about TaskWarrior you can find on their official [website][1],
so now I will try to summarize the reasoning why I think this program deserves
to be loved.
